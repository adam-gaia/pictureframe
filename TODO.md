# TODO
- Could have mat settings (shape and size?) by image, editable in the admin page
- image tagging (giving images optional keywords to filter/group by) requires database migration to add support
  - short term: tagging done manually in admin panel
  - long term: local machine learning tagging program. Maybe some local llm already does this
- setting toggle for the viewer metadata overlay
- admin page should be able to edit the image metadata (title, notes, date taken, etc)
- admin page should show available space left on device!!
  - add some sort of guard where we can't upload images if we don't have some space threshold
- upload should take the files to upload then non-blocking process the files in the background. I think
- Test full end-to-end in browser
- Add body size limit configuration to production server (currently only test router has 50MB limit)
- Wire up `process_inbox()` for automatic photo import
- Add request body validation
- Add proper logging/tracing to handlers
